# Title (replace with your title)

Having the ability to search through text, validate text, and replace text using an advanced set of rules is exactly what Regex is for

## Summary

This guide provides an introduction to regular expressions (regex) and their usage for searching, validating, and replacing text. It covers various components of regex, along with code snippets and explanations.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
^Hello
Explanation:
The caret (^) is an anchor that matches the start of a line. The regex pattern "^Hello" will match any line that starts with the word "Hello
### Quantifiers
\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}
Explanation:
Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group. In this example, "\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}" will match a string in the format "123-45-6789", where \d represents any digit.
### OR Operator
apple|orange
Explanation:
The vertical bar (|) serves as the OR operator, allowing the regex to match either "apple" or "orange". For example, in the string "I love apples and oranges," this pattern will match "apple" and "orange".

Character Classes
### Character Classes
[aeiou]
Explanation:
Character classes ([...]) match any character from a defined set. This example, "[aeiou]", will match any lowercase vowel (a, e, i, o, or u).
### Flags
/regex/i
Explanation:
Flags modify the behavior of regex matching. The "i" flag (after the second slash) makes the pattern case-insensitive, allowing it to match both uppercase and lowercase versions of the text.
### Grouping and Capturing
/(ab)+/
Explanation:
Parentheses () group and capture parts of the matched text. In this case, the pattern "(ab)+" will match sequences like "ab", "abab", "ababab", etc.
### Bracket Expressions
[^0-9]
Explanation:
Bracket expressions (e.g., [^...]) create custom character classes with negation. The pattern "[^0-9]" will match any character that is not a digit.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
<.*>
Explanation:
By default, quantifiers are greedy and match as much as possible. In this example, the pattern "<.*>" will match the entire string between the first "<" and the last ">" encountered in the text.
### Boundaries
\bword\b
Explanation:
Word boundaries (\b) match positions between word and non-word characters. The pattern "\bword\b" will match the whole word "word" and avoid partial matches like "wording" or "sword".
### Back-references
(\d{2})-\1
Explanation:
Back-references (\1, \2, etc.) refer back to previously matched groups. In this case, the pattern "(\d{2})-\1" will match "12-12", "99-99", etc., where the same two-digit number appears twice separated by a hyphen.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
(?<=\$)\d+(\.\d+)?
Explanation:
Look-behind assertion (?<=...) checks if the regex is preceded by a certain pattern. In this example, the pattern "(?<=$)\d+(.\d+)?" will match numbers with an optional decimal point, but only if they are preceded by the dollar sign ($).
